    - Stack overflow detection and recovery finally work fine on Unix.
    - It is now possible to specify the default method-combination of a generic
      function,
    - Readline completion works with non 1:1 terminal encodings, e.g. UTF-8.
    - WITH-KEYBOARD works with a Unix tty even when SLIME hijacks *TERMINAL-IO*.
    - New functions: POSIX:FFS, POSIX:PATHCONF.
    - Bug fixes:
      + SOCKET:SOCKET-SERVER :INTERFACE now behaves as documented.
      + EXT:READ-BYTE-NO-HANG and SOCKET:SOCKET-STATUS used to hang on
        buffered binary sockets.
      + Allow DESTRUCTURING-BIND (a . b) with circular and dotted lists.
      + ADJUST-ARRAY of zero length adjustable string now works.
      + TIME now reports correct results when the heap grows over 4GB.

    Is a working debian host to test this on
    not nice? Sigh. We will see if it fails
    again. Seeing the logs would help.

    Thanks to Ubuntu to actually have the
    buildd logs available.
  * As it is impossible to have a dependency on gcc-3.3
    only for some architectures, have _all_ of them
    depend on gcc-3.3, but add build-essential
    for all other architectures.

clisp (1:2.35-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * So with gcc-4 on sparc we got the pretty impressive:
    ;; Loading file defs1.lisp ...
    *** - quotient GGGGGGGG0GGGGGGGG0GGGGGGGG0GGGGGGGG\
    0GGGGGGGG0GGGGGGGG0GGGGGGGG / GGGGGGGG\
     is not an integer

    Now on m68k we get the even more impressive:

    cat '/build/buildd/clisp-2.35/src/intparam.c' >> tmp.c
    gcc -D SAFETY=3 -D NO_MULTIMAP_SHM -D NO_MULTIMAP_FILE \
     -D NO_SINGLEMAP -D NO_TRIVIALMAP tmp.c -o intparam
    tmp.c: In function 'main5':
    tmp.c:422: internal compiler error: in instantiate_virtual_regs_lossage,
    at function.c:1442

    So we're going to use gcc-3.3 for both architectures and hope
    that upstream or the gcc maintainers get this one right.

    Change: also use gcc-3.3 for m68k.

clisp (1:2.27-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload
  * Previous NMU was becoming hack upon hack upon hack, so I gave up and
    started over.  Last maintainer upload was over 1 year ago.
  * New upstream version (Closes: #96599)
    - Already includes the suggested patch for ARM (Closes: #87395)
  * Repackaged from scratch
    - Doesn't try to remove files outside the build tree (Closes: #74610)
    - Compresses documentation, and separates into clisp-doc
      (Closes: #96602)
    - COPYRIGHT folded into copyright (Closes: #96600)
    - Build dependencies are included (Closes: #70353)

  * Verified that build dependencies are present and sane (Closes: #70353)
  * Removed over 300k of SETI@Home data files added by diff.gz.  This, and
    the improved clean target result in a much more manageable diff.gz.
  * This package needs source code reorganization.  There are a lot of
    files duplicated within the package, and copied from other packages.
  * There is a far newer upstream version (2.27, 2001/07/16) which
    probably fixes many problems.
